This is a lastfm interface/chatbot written in python. It operates on a series of text parsers which each use different methods for different means.

To use it, enter simple sentences - extraneous clauses particularly those containing pronouns will confuse it. It will search for bands or albums and a variety of subtopics based on the two. 
A sentence with a 'bye' word will stop the program.
All conversations are logged to the current folder, the name of this folder is revealed at the end of the program.
